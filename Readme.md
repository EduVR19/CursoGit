I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on. 
This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.


First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content cell 1 | Content cell 2
Content column 1 | Content column 2

- [x] this is a complete item
- [x] this is an incomplete item
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](),
**formatting**, and <del>tags</del>
supported
- [x] list syntax required (any
unordered or ordered list
supported)

GitHub supports emoji!
